# Participant Guide

## Purpose of this experiment

We are comparing how well AI coding agents perform **static security code
audits**. You will read individual Java testcases from OWASP BenchmarkJava and,
for each one, write a structured vulnerability report.

This is **not** a capture-the-flag or exploitation exercise:

- You do **not** need to capture any flag.
- You do **not** need to write or run an exploit.
- You do **not** run the application or any scanner.

You only **read the Java source code** and reason about whether it is
vulnerable. Some cases are genuinely vulnerable; others are deliberate
*false positives* that look risky but are safe. Deciding which is which is the
core of the task.

## What you are evaluated on

For each case we score whether you can:

1. determine whether a real vulnerability exists (`is_vulnerable`),
2. name the vulnerability category (`bug_type`),
3. identify the CWE (`cwe`),
4. explain the root cause (`root_cause`), and
5. propose a fix (`patch_strategy`).

## Which AI agents you may use

You may use any AI coding agent or LLM-based assistant (e.g. Claude Code, an
IDE agent, a chat model). You must **record exactly what you used**:

- `model_or_agent` — the tool/agent (e.g. `claude-code`, `cursor`, `chatgpt`).
- `model_name` — the specific model (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8`).
- `web_search_used` — whether the agent used web search (see below).
- Human intervention level — how much a human helped (see *Recording* below).

## Web search rule (default: NOT allowed)

The default condition is **closed-book**: the agent may use only the Java code
provided in `cases/`. **Web search / browsing is disabled.**

If the organizer explicitly runs an *open-book* round, you may enable web
search, but you must set `"web_search_used": true` in every report so the two
conditions can be compared. When in doubt, keep web search **off**.

## Submission format

Produce **one JSON file per case**, named after the test, e.g.
`BenchmarkTest00027.json`. Each file follows
`report_template.json`:

```json
{
  "test_name": "BenchmarkTest00027",
  "model_or_agent": "claude-code",
  "model_name": "claude-opus-4-8",
  "web_search_used": false,
  "is_vulnerable": true,
  "bug_type": "SQL Injection",
  "cwe": "CWE-89",
  "vulnerable_file": "BenchmarkTest00027.java",
  "vulnerable_function": "doPost",
  "root_cause": "Request parameter is concatenated into a SQL statement without parameterization.",
  "security_impact": "An attacker can inject SQL to read or modify the database.",
  "patch_strategy": "Use a PreparedStatement with bound parameters.",
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

Field notes:

- `is_vulnerable` — `true` or `false` (use your best judgement; `null` scores 0).
- `bug_type` — a category name such as `SQL Injection`, `Cross-Site Scripting`,
  `Command Injection`, `Path Traversal`, `Weak Hash`, `LDAP Injection`.
- `cwe` — `CWE-89` or `89` are both accepted.
- `confidence` — a number from `0.0` to `1.0` (not scored, but recorded).

Place your files under a single folder named after your team or model:

```text
submissions/
  <your_team_or_model_name>/
    BenchmarkTest00027.json
    BenchmarkTest00294.json
    ...
```

## Recording your run

In **every** JSON, fill in `model_or_agent`, `model_name`, and
`web_search_used` accurately. Additionally, note in your submission folder (a
short `notes.md` is fine) the **human intervention level**, e.g.:

- *none* — the agent produced the JSON unaided,
- *light* — a human fixed formatting / re-prompted,
- *heavy* — a human materially changed the verdict or reasoning.

## Checklist before submitting

- [ ] One JSON per case, named `BenchmarkTestNNNNN.json`.
- [ ] `test_name` matches the file.
- [ ] `is_vulnerable` is `true`/`false` (not `null`).
- [ ] `cwe` and `bug_type` filled in.
- [ ] `model_or_agent`, `model_name`, `web_search_used` recorded.
- [ ] Human intervention level noted.
